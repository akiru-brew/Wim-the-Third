## Estimates

From [brewers friend](https://www.brewersfriend.com)

| OG    | FG    | Calories     | Carbs         | ABV  | IBU  | SRM  |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ | ------------- |---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1.080 | 1.017 | 265 per 330ml | 25g per 330ml | 8.25% | 8   | 14.6   |

The [BJCP SRM guide](https://www.brewersfriend.com/2017/05/07/beer-styles-srm-color-chart-2017-update/) is an interesting read. It suggests my beer will be a bit too dark for the style, but as long as it tastes nice I'm sure I will cope.


## Process

This is (hopefully) a simple Belgian triple, which will form part of an experiment in the future. But that's for another time.

The one thing I tweaked from the calculations was the amount of water used. Maybe it's because I like making strong beers but I barely cover the grain with the recommended amount of liquor so always end up adding more to prevent a stuck mash.

Although I didn't need much water to mash (according to the calculators) I needed a certain amount to cover the grain in the tube. Thus the grain has a lot of freedom to move around and so I'd expect a highly efficient mash. My revised approach is:
* Mash water: 21 litres
* Sparge water: 4 litres
* Boil time: 90 minutes

Adding more water means diluting it too much, but hopefully a longer boil will reduce some of the excess.

## Kegging

I've bought a keg :)


## Lessons learnt

* My kettle sparges during the mash. Al long as I run a whirlpool I can get away with ~1 litre for the manual sparge. This will make mashing easier.
